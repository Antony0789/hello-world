Bonjour citoyens
Everything is code is the sense that programers mean when they write code. This realisation that everything is code and code moving on many levels is more primary than the perception that things are made from space time matter and energy. The code codes for space time matter and energy. The universe is a mystery, there are doors and locks, and if you get it right, it can give way to something extremely unexpected.
